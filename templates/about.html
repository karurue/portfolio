People know me as Karurue Caroline Waruguru. Born on 12th March 2000. Am a Pisces. There is something about pisces that many do not know:<br>
<ol><li>They have an attractive personality</li>
<li>They are shut reserved and secretive</li>
<li>They are naturally honest, generous, sympathetic, loves peace and serenity</li>
<li>They hardly show emotions, tends to bottle up feelings, are observant and asses others.</li>
I dont know if i do all that but oooh well thats what research says. Am my own brand. i keep my small circle of everything literally. I may get emotional most of the times but once am through it is all over. Sometimes i think am tall but when i look at other people i am soo short. My life is simple. I treasure my family soo much. All i want to do afterwards is LAW.<br>

<h2 style="color:red">What inspires me? </h2>
                    <p>
<ul><li><h2>DREAMS</h2> </li><li><h2>FAITH</h2></li><br>
		 <dt style="color:red" >DREAMS</dt><dd style="color:green">As much as i love Africa so much, it is my dream to travel most of the parts in the world more. From the seven wonders of the world such as the great wall of china and many more. i know i will be a great lawyer in the future. to be the likes of James Orengo, Paul Muite and Wycliff. One day i will create my own law firm. i have learn how to DREAM BIG. Just like how a child looks up to the sky when an aeroplane passes and dreams to be on it is how ones vision starts.<br>
		 JUST LIKE A WINNER DREAM BIG.
		 <dt style="color:red" >FAITH</dt><dd style="color:green">As we all know 'Faith moves mountains'. This is is so true. Whenever some things look so hard to accomplish all you have to do is have FAITH and PRAY about it persistently. At the end, through the difficulties it will all work out and you will say:<br>
          JESUS DID IT AGAIN		 </dd></dd></ul></p>
